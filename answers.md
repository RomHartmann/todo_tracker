Answers to questions
====================

## 1 Expand on experience with python

I started off at startups, doing data science stuff, coupled loosly with some web-development focused around data visualisation.  
With time my focus evolved more to data + software engineering, as the core data science applications needed to be productionized.
For most part the services we built ended up as microservice architectures, which means lots of 
little flask apps, dockerized and sitting in Kubernetes, so most of my experience building REST apis
has been building backwards facing microservices, in flask (because more lightweight, and so the docker images are smaller).  
I've used Django before for REST apis, so I know my way around it a bit, but I've never built anything expansive in it.

As a side note, I was looking into familiarizing myself again with Django for webapps when I got this little 
assignment, so you'll find some rudimentary frontend stuff in this project as well.


## 2 Docker

Yes, as per above.  Kubernetes usually sat in Google, though I've deployed a Kubernetes cluster to AWS before.
Kubernetes is sweet.


## 3 AWS

S3, EC2, ECS, ECR, VPC, RDS
Basically whatever it took to set up Kubernetes in AWS EC2
And often postgres sits in AWS RDS I guess

# 4 Linux

Yup.  Running that sweet open source magic on my laptop.

# 5 Git

Yup.  I've got personal code sitting in Github, GitLab and unfortunately even bitbucket.  The latter two because
it was a personal project with some friends.  Github because it's just so nice.

# 6 Open source

Nope.  Nothing officially useful.

# 7 Django app

Please see the README.md
